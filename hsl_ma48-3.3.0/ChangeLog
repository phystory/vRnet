2014-01-14  Iain Duff and Jonathan Hogg
* Version 3.3.0.
Fix uninitialised variable bug wrt factors%partial.
Fix error in C interface where finfo was expected to be passed by value instead
of by reference.

2013-03-21  Jonathan Hogg
* Version 3.2.0.
   * Add MATLAB interface
   * Add C interface
   * Use stricter public/private controls to avoid namespace pollution
   * Remove dependance on FD15 (replaced with F95 intrinsics)
	* Reduce differences between single and double precision codes
	* Fix innocous undefined variable bug identified by nagfor

2011-05-06  Iain Duff
* Version 3.1.0.
Correction of a bug in copying reals to auxiliary array for analysis
phase.  The package would still give the correct factorization but the
times and number of entries in the factors could be increased
considerably.
Also more arrays have been made long integer because mapping is stored
in main integer arrays.  This affects components irn and jcn of factors.

2011-02-01  Iain Duff
* Version 3.0.0.
Many changes including incorporating modified Fortran 95 versions of auxiliary
routines in the package. Main changes include:
   * the use of long integers,
   * the ability to continue the factorization if the initial space allocated
     for the factors was too small,
   * and the decoupling of the lengths of some real and integer arrays.

2010-02-08
* Version 2.1.0.
Components of ma48_factors made public for use within hsl_mi20 matlab interface

2006-12-14
* Version 2.0.0.
   * Sizes of cntl, icntl, info, rinfo increased for compatibility with new
     version of ma48.
   * Immediate return from MA48B/BD if LA is too small.
   * control%switch_mode add to control whether a switch to slow mode made when
      fast mode given unsuitable pivot sequence.
   * Pointer components of the derived type made allocatable (ZD11)

2006-12-14
* Version 1.5.1.
Error return added for pivot failure during fast factorize.

2006-12-01
* Version 1.4.1.
Deallocates in ma48_finalize separated out.

2006-10-05
* Version 1.4.0.
Argument factors of ma48_solve given intent(in) instead of intent(inout).

2006-06-28
* Version 1.3.0.
Value of la in ma48_analyse increased to ensure that the arrays irn, icn, val
are big enough for the original matrix.

2006-04-27
* Version 1.2.0.
   * Component drop of type ma48_finfo changed to integer.
   * Calculation of INFO(4) in subroutine NONZER corrected for the case of a
     triangular matrix.

2006-02-28
* Version 1.1.0. To avoid memory leaks, ma48_initialize and ma48_finalize leave
pointer component null instead having zero size.


2004-07-12
* Version 1.0.0.
Version numbering added.

2001-10-18
* Original date.
